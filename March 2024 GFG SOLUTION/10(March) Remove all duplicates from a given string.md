## 10. Remove Duplicate Characters

The problem statement can be found at the following link: [Question Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/remove-all-duplicates-from-a-given-string4321/1)

### My Approach

1. **Initialization:**

   - Initialize an empty unordered set `seen` to store characters that have been encountered.
   - Initialize an empty string `result` to store the final output.

2. **Iteration Process:**

   - Iterate through each character `c` in the input string `str`.

3. **Check for Duplicates:**

   - For each character `c`, check if it has been seen before. If not, append it to the `result` string and add it to the `seen` set.

4. **Finalization:**
   - After iterating through all characters in the input string, return the `result` string containing unique characters only.

This approach effectively removes duplicate characters from the input string while maintaining the original order of characters.

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the length of the input string.
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity**: O(N), where N is the length of the input string, for storing unique characters in the unordered set.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    std::string removeDuplicates(std::string str) {
        std::unordered_set<char> seen;
        std::string result = "";

        for (char& c : str) {
            if (seen.find(c) == seen.end()) {
                result += c;
                seen.insert(c);
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
};

```
