# _17. Aggressive Cows_

The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/aggressive-cows/1)

## Problem Description

You are given an array `stalls[]` representing the positions of stalls, where each position is unique. You are also given an integer `k`, which is the number of aggressive cows to place. Your task is to assign the cows to the stalls such that the **minimum distance** between any two cows is maximized.

### Examples:

**Input:**  
`stalls[] = [1, 2, 4, 8, 9], k = 3`  
**Output:**  
`3`

**Explanation:**

- Place the first cow at `stalls[0]`, the second at `stalls[2]`, and the third at `stalls[3]`.
- The minimum distance between cows is `3`, which is the largest possible.

**Input:**  
`stalls[] = [10, 1, 2, 7, 5], k = 3`  
**Output:**  
`4`

**Explanation:**

- Place cows at positions `10`, `1`, and `5`.
- The minimum distance is `4`.

### Constraints:

- $`2 <= stalls.size() <= 10^6`$
- $`0 <= stalls[i] <= 10^8`$
- $`1 <= k <= stalls.size()`$

## My Approach

1. **Binary Search on the Distance:**

   - To maximize the minimum distance between cows, we can use **binary search** on the range of distances.
   - The range of distances is `[1, stalls[n-1] - stalls[0]]`.

2. **Check Feasibility:**

   - For a given `mid` (distance), determine if it‚Äôs possible to place all `k` cows in the stalls such that the distance between consecutive cows is at least `mid`.
   - If placing cows is feasible, increase the minimum distance. Otherwise, decrease it.

3. **Steps:**
   - Sort the `stalls` array.
   - Use binary search to determine the largest minimum distance.
   - For each mid, iterate through stalls to count the cows that can be placed with at least `mid` distance.

## Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

**Expected Time Complexity:**

`O(n * log(m))`, where `n` is the size of the array, and `m` is the range of stall positions (`max - min`). Sorting takes `O(n log m)`, and binary search with feasibility checking takes `O(n * log m)`.

**Expected Auxiliary Space Complexity:**

`O(1)`, as we use a constant amount of additional space.

## Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int aggressiveCows(vector<int>& stalls, int k) {
        sort(stalls.begin(), stalls.end());
        int low = 1, high = stalls.back() - stalls.front(), mid;

        while (low <= high) {
            mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            int count = 1, last = stalls[0];
            for (int i = 1; i < stalls.size(); i++)
                if (stalls[i] - last >= mid) { count++; last = stalls[i]; }
            if (count >= k) low = mid + 1;
            else high = mid - 1;
        }
        return high;
    }
};
```

## Code (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public static int aggressiveCows(int[] stalls, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(stalls);
        int low = 1, high = stalls[stalls.length - 1] - stalls[0], result = 0;

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            int count = 1, lastPlaced = stalls[0];
            for (int i = 1; i < stalls.length; i++) {
                if (stalls[i] - lastPlaced >= mid) {
                    count++;
                    lastPlaced = stalls[i];
                }
            }
            if (count >= k) {
                result = mid;
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def aggressiveCows(self, stalls, k):
        stalls.sort()
        low, high = 1, stalls[-1] - stalls[0]

        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            count, last_placed = 1, stalls[0]
            for i in range(1, len(stalls)):
                if stalls[i] - last_placed >= mid:
                    count += 1
                    last_placed = stalls[i]
            if count >= k:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        return high
```
