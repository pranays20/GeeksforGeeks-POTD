# <b>16. Maximize The Cut Segments</b>

The problem can be found at the following link: [Question Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/cutted-segments1642/1)

### Problem Description

Given an integer `n` denoting the length of a line segment, the task is to cut the line segment into the maximum number of smaller segments such that the length of each segment is either `x`, `y`, or `z`. Here, `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers representing possible segment lengths.

If it is not possible to make any cuts, return 0.

**Example:**

Input:

```
n = 4, x = 2, y = 1, z = 1
```

Output:

```
4
```

Explanation: The total length is 4, and the cut lengths are 2, 1, and 1. We can make a maximum of 4 segments, each of length 1.

### My Approach

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Initialization:**

   - Create a DP array `dp` of size `n + 1` initialized to -1, except `dp[0]` which is set to 0. This array will store the maximum number of segments that can be made for each length from 0 to `n`.
   - Initialize an array `cuts` containing the values `x`, `y`, and `z`.

2. **Filling the DP Array:**

   - Iterate through each length `i` from 1 to `n`.
   - For each length `i`, iterate over the possible cuts in `cuts`. If the current length `i` is greater than or equal to the cut length and the previous length `i - cut` can be achieved (`dp[i - cut] != -1`), update `dp[i]` as the maximum of its current value and `dp[i - cut] + 1`.

3. **Final Result:**
   - The final result is stored in `dp[n]`. If `dp[n]` is -1, return 0, indicating no segments can be made. Otherwise, return `dp[n]`, which represents the maximum number of segments.

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Expected Time Complexity:** O(n), as we are iterating through each possible length from 1 to `n` and checking up to three possible cuts for each length.
- **Expected Auxiliary Space Complexity:** O(n), as we are using a DP array of size `n + 1` to store the maximum number of segments for each length.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximizeTheCuts(int n, int x, int y, int z) {
        int dp[n + 1];
        memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));
        dp[0] = 0;

        int cuts[] = {x, y, z};

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                if (i >= cuts[j] && dp[i - cuts[j]] != -1) {
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - cuts[j]] + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n] == -1 ? 0 : dp[n];
    }
};
```

### Code (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximizeCuts(int n, int x, int y, int z) {
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        Arrays.fill(dp, -1);
        dp[0] = 0;

        int[] cuts = {x, y, z};

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                if (i >= cuts[j] && dp[i - cuts[j]] != -1) {
                    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[i - cuts[j]] + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n] == -1 ? 0 : dp[n];
    }
}
```

### Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def maximizeTheCuts(self, n, x, y, z):
        dp = [-1] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 0

        cuts = [x, y, z]

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            for cut in cuts:
                if i >= cut and dp[i - cut] != -1:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - cut] + 1)

        return dp[n] if dp[n] != -1 else 0
```
