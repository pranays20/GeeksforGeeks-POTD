# _16. Largest Subarray of 0s and 1s_

The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/largest-subarray-of-0s-and-1s/1)

## Problem Description

You are given a binary array `arr[]` consisting of `0s` and `1s`. Your task is to find the length of the largest subarray that contains an equal number of `0s` and `1s`.

## Examples:

**Input:**  
`arr[] = [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]`  
**Output:**  
`6`

**Explanation:** The subarray `[0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]` has an equal number of 0s and 1s (three 0s and three 1s).

**Input:**  
`arr[] = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]`  
**Output:**  
`4`

**Explanation:** Both `[0, 0, 1, 1]` and `[0, 1, 1, 0]` are valid subarrays with an equal number of 0s and 1s.

**Input:**  
`arr[] = [0]`  
**Output:**  
`0`

**Explanation:** No subarray has an equal number of 0s and 1s.

### Constraints:

- $`1 <= arr.size() <= 10^5`$
- `arr[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

## My Approach

### HashMap and Prefix Sum Technique

To solve this problem efficiently, we use a hashmap to store the first occurrence of prefix sums. This helps us determine the length of subarrays with equal numbers of 0s and 1s:

1. Treat `0` as `-1` to convert the problem into finding a subarray with sum `0`.
2. Maintain a `prefix sum` while iterating over the array.
3. Use a hashmap to store the first index where each prefix sum occurs.
4. If the same prefix sum is encountered again, the subarray between these two indices has a sum of `0` (indicating equal numbers of `0s` and `1s`).
5. Update the maximum length for each valid subarray.

### Steps:

1. Initialize a hashmap to store prefix sums and their first occurrence index.
2. Replace all `0s` with `-1` in the array.
3. Traverse the array while maintaining a prefix sum:
   - If the prefix sum is `0`, the subarray from the start to the current index is valid.
   - If the prefix sum has been seen before, calculate the length of the subarray and update the maximum length.
   - Otherwise, store the prefix sum with its index.
4. Return the maximum length.

## Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Expected Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the size of the array. Each element is processed once, and hashmap operations (insert and lookup) are O(1) on average.
- **Expected Auxiliary Space Complexity:** O(n), as the hashmap stores at most `n` unique prefix sums.

## Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxLen(vector<int>& arr) {
        unordered_map<int, int> hM;
        int sum = 0, max_len = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            sum += (arr[i] == 0) ? -1 : 1;
            if (sum == 0) max_len = i + 1;
            if (hM.count(sum)) max_len = max(max_len, i - hM[sum]);
            else hM[sum] = i;
        }
        return max_len;
    }
};
```

## Code (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxLen(int[] arr) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int sum = 0, maxLen = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            sum += (arr[i] == 0) ? -1 : 1;
            if (sum == 0) maxLen = i + 1;
            else if (map.containsKey(sum)) maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, i - map.get(sum));
            else map.put(sum, i);
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
}
```

## Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxLen(self, arr):
        hmap = {}
        sum, max_len = 0, 0
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            sum += -1 if arr[i] == 0 else 1
            if sum == 0:
                max_len = i + 1
            elif sum in hmap:
                max_len = max(max_len, i - hmap[sum])
            else:
                hmap[sum] = i
        return max_len
```
