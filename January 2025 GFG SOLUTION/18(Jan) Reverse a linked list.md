## Examples:

**Input:**  
`head: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL`

### Constraints:

- 1 <= number of nodes, data of nodes <= $10^5$

## My Approach

1. **Iterative Reversal Algorithm**:  
   The problem can be efficiently solved using an iterative approach by traversing the linked list and reversing the `next` pointers of each node.

   - Start with two pointers: `prev` (initialized to `NULL`) and `current` (initialized to the head of the list).
   - In each iteration, update the `next` pointer of the `current` node to point to the `prev` node, then move `prev` and `current` forward.
   - Continue the process until the entire list is reversed.

2. **Steps:**
   - Initialize `prev` to `NULL` and `current` to the head of the list.
   - Traverse the list while `current` is not `NULL`.
   - For each node, reverse the `next` pointer to point to `prev`.
   - Move the `prev` and `current` pointers one step forward.
   - Once the list is completely reversed, return `prev` as the new head.

## Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Expected Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the entire list once.
- **Expected Auxiliary Space Complexity:** O(1), as we only use a constant amount of additional space (for the `prev` and `current` pointers).

## Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Node* reverseList(Node* head) {
        Node *prev = NULL, *curr = head, *next;
        while (curr) {
            next = curr->next;
            curr->next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = next;
        }
        return prev;
    }
};
```

## **Pointer Manipulation Using `swap` for Linked List Reversal**

#### Explanation:

This approach leverages **pointer manipulation** to reverse the linked list in place, using the `swap` function to reduce the verbosity of code and streamline pointer updates. The key idea is to iteratively reverse the `next` pointers of each node while traversing the list.

#### Detailed Steps:

1. **Initialization**:

   - `prev` is initialized to `nullptr` (to mark the new end of the reversed list).
   - `head` starts as the current node in the original list.

2. **Iterative Reversal**:

   - In each iteration of the loop, two swaps are used to reassign pointers:
     - Swap `head->next` with `prev`: This updates the current node's `next` pointer to point to the previous node.
     - Swap `head` with `prev`: This shifts the `prev` pointer to the current node (marking progress in the reversed list) and moves the `head` pointer forward to the next node in the original list.

3. **Termination**:

   - The loop continues until `head` becomes `nullptr` (indicating the end of the list has been reached).
   - At this point, `prev` holds the new head of the reversed linked list.

4. **Return Value**:
   - The method returns `prev`, which now points to the reversed list's head.

## Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    Node* reverseList(Node* head) {
        Node *prev = nullptr;
        while (head) {
            swap(head->next, prev), swap(head, prev);
        }
        return prev;
    }
};
```

#### Key Characteristics:

- **Runtime Efficiency**:
  - The approach has a time complexity of \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the list. Each node is processed exactly once.
- **Space Efficiency**:
  - The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as no additional memory is used apart from a few pointers.

#### Example Walkthrough:

Let the initial linked list be: $\(1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow \text{nullptr}\)$

1. **Initialization**: `prev = nullptr`, `head = 1`
2. **First Iteration**:
   - Swap `head->next` and `prev`: Now `1->next = nullptr`
   - Swap `head` and `prev`: `prev = 1`, `head = 2`
3. **Second Iteration**:
   - Swap `head->next` and `prev`: Now `2->next = 1`
   - Swap `head` and `prev`: `prev = 2`, `head = 3`
4. **Third Iteration**:
   - Swap `head->next` and `prev`: Now `3->next = 2`
   - Swap `head` and `prev`: `prev = 3`, `head = nullptr`
5. **Termination**:
   - `head` is `nullptr`, and `prev` points to the reversed list: $\(3 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow \text{nullptr}\)$

## Code (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    Node reverseList(Node head) {
        Node prev = null;
        while (head != null) {
            Node next = head.next;
            head.next = prev;
            prev = head;
            head = next;
        }
        return prev;
    }
}
```

## Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head):
        prev = None
        while head:
            next = head.next
            head.next = prev
            prev = head
            head = next
        return prev
```
