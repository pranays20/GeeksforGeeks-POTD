# _06. Sum Pair Closest to Target_

The problem can be found at the following link: [Problem Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/pair-in-array-whose-sum-is-closest-to-x1124/1)

## Problem Description

You are given an array `arr[]` and a number `target`. Your task is to find a pair of elements `(a, b)` in `arr[]` where `a <= b` whose sum is closest to the target. If there are multiple such pairs, return the pair with the maximum absolute difference. If no such pair exists, return an empty array.

## Examples:

**Input:**  
`arr[] = [10, 30, 20, 5], target = 25`  
**Output:**  
`[5, 20]`

**Input:**  
`arr[] = [5, 2, 7, 1, 4], target = 10`  
**Output:**  
`[2, 7]`  
Explanation: As both `(4, 7)` and `(2, 7)` are closest to the target 10, the absolute difference of `(2, 7)` is 5 and `(4, 7)` is 3. Hence, `[2, 7]` is the correct pair.

**Input:**  
`arr[] = [10], target = 10`  
**Output:**  
`[]`  
Explanation: The array contains only one element, so no valid pair can be formed.

### Constraints:

- $`1 <= arr.size() <= 2*10^5`$
- $`0 <= target <= 2*10^5`$
- $`0 <= arr[i] <= 10^5`$

## My Approach

1. **Sorting and Two-pointer Approach**:
   - First, sort the array.
   - Use two pointers, `l` (left) and `r` (right), to traverse the array. Start by initializing `l` at the beginning and `r` at the end.
   - Calculate the sum of `arr[l]` and `arr[r]` and check how close it is to the target. Track the pair that gives the smallest difference.
   - Move the pointers based on whether the sum is less than or greater than the target, to attempt getting closer to the target.
   - If multiple pairs have the same sum, the one with the largest absolute difference should be returned.
   - Continue this process until the pointers meet.

## Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Expected Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is because we need to sort the array, and sorting takes O(n log n) time. After sorting, the two-pointer traversal takes O(n) time.
- **Expected Auxiliary Space Complexity:** O(1), as we only use a constant amount of additional space (for the two pointers and result storage).

## Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sumClosest(vector<int>& arr, int target) {
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        vector<int> res;
        for (int l = 0, r = arr.size() - 1, minDiff = INT_MAX; l < r;) {
            int sum = arr[l] + arr[r], diff = abs(target - sum);
            if (diff < minDiff) minDiff = diff, res = {arr[l], arr[r]};
            sum < target ? ++l : --r;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

## Code (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> sumClosest(int[] arr, int target) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int l = 0, r = arr.length - 1, minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        while (l < r) {
            int sum = arr[l] + arr[r], diff = Math.abs(target - sum);
            if (diff < minDiff) {
                minDiff = diff;
                res = Arrays.asList(arr[l], arr[r]);
            }
            if (sum < target) l++;
            else r--;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

## Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def sumClosest(self, arr, target):
        arr.sort()
        l, r, minDiff, res = 0, len(arr) - 1, float('inf'), []
        while l < r:
            s = arr[l] + arr[r]
            if abs(target - s) < minDiff:
                minDiff, res = abs(target - s), [arr[l], arr[r]]
            l += s < target
            r -= s >= target
        return res
```
