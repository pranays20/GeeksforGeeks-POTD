## 11. Juggler Sequence

The problem can be found at the following link: [Question Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/juggler-sequence3930/1)

### Problem Description

Given a number \(n\), find the Juggler Sequence for this number as the first term of the sequence until it becomes 1. The Juggler Sequence is a series of integers generated using a recurrence relation.

**Example:**
Input:

```
n = 9
```

Output:

```
9 27 140 11 36 6 2 1
```

Explanation:
We start with 9 and use the Juggler Formula to generate the next terms until the sequence becomes 1.

### My Approach

1. **Initialization:**

- Create a vector `ans` to store the Juggler Sequence.
- Push the initial term \(n\) into the vector.

2. **Sequence Generation:**

- Iterate until the last term of the sequence becomes 1.
- Calculate the next term of the sequence using the Juggler Formula:
  - If the current term is even, the next term is \(\sqrt{\text{current term}}\).
  - If the current term is odd, the next term is \(\sqrt{\text{current term}}^3\).
- Push the next term into the vector.

3. **Return:**

- Return the vector `ans` containing the Juggler Sequence.

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Expected Time Complexity:** O(n), as we iterate until the last term of the sequence becomes 1.
- **Expected Auxiliary Space Complexity:** O(n), as we use a vector to store the Juggler Sequence.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    std::vector<long long> jugglerSequence(long long n) {
        std::vector<long long> res;
        res.push_back(n);

        while (n > 1) {
            if (n % 2)
                n = static_cast<long long>(std::sqrt(n) * n);
            else
                n = static_cast<long long>(std::sqrt(n));

            res.push_back(n);
        }

        return res;
    }
};
```
