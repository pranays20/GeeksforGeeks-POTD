# _01. Multiply Two Linked Lists_

The problem can be found at the following link: [Question Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/multiply-two-linked-lists/1)

### Problem Description

Given elements as nodes of two singly linked lists, the task is to multiply these two linked lists, L1 and L2. The nodes contain digits, and the linked lists represent numbers.

- You are required to return the multiplication of these two numbers modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

#### Example 1:

Input:

- LinkedList L1: 3 -> 2
- LinkedList L2: 2

Output:

- 64

Explanation: Multiplication of 32 and 2 gives 64.

### Constraints:

- \(1 \leq \text{number of nodes} \leq 10^5\)
- \(1 \leq \text{node.data} \leq 10^3\)

### My Approach

1. **Linked List to Number Conversion:**

   - Traverse through each linked list, treating the digits as part of a number, and accumulate the number formed.
   - While calculating the number from the linked lists, take the modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to prevent overflow.

2. **Multiplication and Modulo Operation:**

   - Multiply the two numbers obtained from the linked lists.
   - Take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to ensure the result is within the specified range.

3. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - Both linked lists have only one node, making the result straightforward.
   - Consider large numbers with long lists by applying the modulo at every step to manage overflow.

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Expected Time Complexity:** (O(max(n, m))), where (n) is the length of L1 and (m) is the length of L2, as we need to traverse each list once to convert it into a number.
- **Expected Auxiliary Space Complexity:** (O(1)), since no extra space beyond a few variables is required.

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
  public:
    long long multiplyTwoLists(Node *first, Node *second) {
        long long num1 = 0, num2 = 0;
        const int MOD = 1000000007;
        while (first != NULL) {
            num1 = (num1 * 10 + first->data) % MOD;
            first = first->next;
        }
        while (second != NULL) {
            num2 = (num2 * 10 + second->data) % MOD;
            second = second->next;
        }
        return (num1 * num2) % MOD;
    }
};
```

### Code (Java)

```java
class Solution {
    public long multiplyTwoLists(Node first, Node second) {
        long num1 = 0, num2 = 0;
        final int MOD = 1000000007;

        while (first != null) {
            num1 = (num1 * 10 + first.data) % MOD;
            first = first.next;
        }

        while (second != null) {
            num2 = (num2 * 10 + second.data) % MOD;
            second = second.next;
        }

        return (num1 * num2) % MOD;
    }
}
```

### Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def multiply_two_lists(self, first, second):
        num1 = 0
        num2 = 0
        MOD = 1000000007
        while first is not None:
            num1 = (num1 * 10 + first.data) % MOD
            first = first.next
        while second is not None:
            num2 = (num2 * 10 + second.data) % MOD
            second = second.next
        return (num1 * num2) % MOD
```
